## Upgrading from Pressbooks 3.x to Pressbooks 4.x

Pressbooks 4.0 requires that themes previously bundled with Pressbooks 3.9.x be installed separately. Two themes are required for all Pressbooks installations, whether you previously used them or not:

*   [Pressbooks Book][1]
*   [Pressbooks Publisher][2]

The remaining themes are optional but required if you previously used them:

*   [Austen Classic][3]
*   [Clarke][4]
*   [Donham][5]
*   [Fitzgerald][6]
*   [Custom CSS][7]
