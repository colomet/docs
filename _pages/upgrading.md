## Upgrading from Pressbooks 3.x to Pressbooks 4.x

Pressbooks >= 4.0 requires that themes previously bundled with Pressbooks 3.x be installed separately. For installation instructions, consult the readme of the themes you need to install below.

Two themes are required for all Pressbooks installations:

*   [Pressbooks Book (Luther)][1]
*   [Pressbooks Publisher][2]

The remaining themes are recommended but optional, and they are required if you used them on Pressbooks 3.x:

*   [Austen Classic][3]
*   [Clarke][4]
*   [Donham][5]
*   [Fitzgerald][6]
*   [Custom CSS][7]
