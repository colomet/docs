<h3>4.0.0</h3>
<strong>NOTICE:</strong> Upon upgrading to Pressbooks 4.0, you will need to install the <a href="https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-book">Pressbooks Book</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-publisher">Pressbooks Publisher</a> themes along with any of our other open source <a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Abook-theme+org%3Apressbooks&amp;type=Repositories">book themes</a> that were bundled with earlier versions of Pressbooks. For more information, see the <a href="upgrading.md">upgrading instructions</a>.

<strong>NOTICE:</strong> Pressbooks 4.0 requires <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/">WordPress 4.8.0</a>.
<h4>Pressbooks 4.0 "Slate"</h4>
<h5>Next-Generation REST API</h5>
Building on <a href="http://bradpayne.ca">Brad Payne's</a> original REST API for Pressbooks, we've introduced an improved and expanded REST API based on the WordPress Core <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/">REST API</a> infrastructure. The Pressbooks REST API v2 supports authenticated CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) access to all Pressbooks content types (front and back matter, parts, and chapters) as well as read-only access to book structure and metadata. For more information, see our <a href="http://docs.pressbooks.org/api">REST API documentation</a>. We're excited to see what the Pressbooks Open Source community will do with these new API capabilities! Share your projects with us: <a href="mailto:code@pressbooks.com">code@pressbooks.com</a>.
<h5>Enhanced LaTeX Rendering</h5>
Pressbooks' core LaTeX renderer now produces high resolution output suitable for print! More improvements to come, and thanks for your patience as we've worked to improve this important feature.
<h5>Better Content Management</h5>
Want to mark all chapters for export on the Organize screen? You can do that now! Trashed something that you want back? Just navigate to Text ‚Üí Trash and you can restore it. Many more improvements to come!
<h5>Pressbooks CLI</h5>
The Pressbooks command line interface is now part of Pressbooks. Want to make your own book theme? Run <code>wp scaffold book-theme</code> from the root of your Pressbooks install and take advantage of our intuitive SCSS-based theme structure. More commands to come -- <a href="https://github.com/pressbooks/pb-cli/issues">submit your ideas</a>!
